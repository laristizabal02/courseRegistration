# [Course Registration](https://courseregistration-pex9.onrender.com/login)

## Description

Working parents struggle to support their children.  Single parents and households where both parents work struggle to support their kids before and after school. Add daycare, afterschool enrichment, rec centers, camps to the mix and parents are overwhelmed. Having one place online where parents can sign their children up for outside schooltime activities helps immensely.

This is why we have developed Course Registration, a centralized, easy-to-use application for signing children up for before and afterschool activities.  Parents can login, manage their family‚Äôs data and sign their children up for available activities based on their location.

This application provides a starting point for providing a valuable for before and after school providers to offer activities for enrollment and for families to conveniently view available activities and enroll their children.
This project allowed us to learn about selecting technologies to construct a full stack application and how to integrate them as seamlessly as possible.
